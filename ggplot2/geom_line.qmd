Line charts are commonly used to display changes of a __continuous variable__ over another __continuous variable__.
This can be used to great effect to see numerical changes over time.

In this page we will create line charts with `ggplot2::geom_line()`. Through examples we will demonstrate creating:

- A line charts with one line.
- A line chart with multiple lines each representing a different group.
- A stepped line chart.

## Dataset

For demonstration we'll load the `fisheries_long_tbl` data from the [mgrtibbles package](/datasets/mgrtibbles.qmd) (hyperlink includes install instructions).
We will filter to keep only rows from EU, Japan, Peru, and USA, and the year 2000 onwards.

[fisheries_long_tbl details](https://github.com/m-gemmell/mgrtibbles/wiki/fisheries_long_tbl)

```{r}
#Load package
library("mgrtibbles")
#mammal_sleep_tbl tibble for demonstration
fisheries_long_tbl<- mgrtibbles::fisheries_long_tbl |>
    #Filter to only retain rows from certain countries
    # and to keep years from 2000 onwards
    dplyr::filter(Entity %in% c("European Union",  "Japan", "Peru", "United States") , 
                    Year >= 2000)
```

`r hide("View fisheries_long_tbl contents")`
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("reactable")
options(reactable.theme = reactableTheme(
  color = "hsl(233, 9%, 87%)",
  backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 19%)",
  borderColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 22%)",
  stripedColor = "hsl(233, 12%, 22%)",
  highlightColor = "hsl(233, 12%, 24%)",
  inputStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  selectStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  pageButtonHoverStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  pageButtonActiveStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 28%)")
))
fisheries_long_tbl |>
    reactable::reactable()
```
`r unhide()`

## Single line chart

When creating a line chart only one y value can be assigned to each x value per line.
To create a line chart with only one line we will plot the information for Japan.

Create a line chart of __Metric_tons__ (y) against __Year__ (x) for Japan.
Additionally, we'll set `linewidth=1` in `ggplot::geom_line()` to make the line thicker for clarity.

```{r}
fisheries_long_tbl |>
    #Filter to only retain Japan
    dplyr::filter(Entity=="Japan") |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Metric_tons)) +
    ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 1)
```

`r hide("Plotting with multiple y values per x value")`
Although you can create a line chart with multiple x values per y values it becomes impossible to read fully.

The below example plots a line chart with the ___tibble__ without filtering out one Entity or colour grouping by Entity (see below).
As there are four entities (EU, Japan, Peru, USA) this means there are four y values per year which are all connected before moving ont the next year.

```{r}
fisheries_long_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Metric_tons)) +
    ggplot2::geom_step(linewidth = 1)
```
`r unhide()`

## Multiple lines chart

Line charts are great for showing changes across a time range of several groups.
Each group can be represented as a coloured line on the same chart.

Create a __Metric_tons__ (y) against __Year__ (x) line chart for our __tibble__.
In `aes()` set `colour=Entity` so each Entity will be represented a by separate coloured line.

```{r}
fisheries_long_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Metric_tons, colour = Entity)) +
    ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 1)
```

## Steps

An optional method for a line chart is a stepped line chart.
This can make it a bit easier to compare the individual values between coloured groups.

Create a __Metric_tons__ (y) against __Year__ (x) stepped line chart for our __tibble__.
In `aes()` set `colour=Entity` so each Entity will be represented a by separate coloured line.

```{r}
fisheries_long_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Metric_tons, colour = Entity)) +
    ggplot2::geom_step(linewidth = 1)
```
