## Overview

__Ggplot2__ is the visualisation package of __Tidyverse__.
It utilises the __grammar of graphics__ (the gg in ggplot2) to create plots/figures in a layered/compartmentalised fashion.

There are multiple parts of a __ggplot2__ figure including:

- The __ggplot2__ object that contains the aesthetics
- The __aesthetics__: This is the data and what they are mapped to (x axis, y-axis, colour etc.)
- The __geom__ layers: This is how the aesthetics are visualised (bar chart, boxplot, histogram etc.)
- The __guides__: The text and other information on the axes abd legends (labels, titles, etc.)
- __Facetting__: Splitting of data to multiple plots (e.g. side by side box plots displaying different metrics)


[ggplot2 homepage](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org//)

This website aims to quickly cover the most commonly used `ggplot2` functions and uses.
Therefore there are a lot more `ggplot2` functions than those covered here.
Please check the below link for the full list.

## Sections

There are various sections for `ggplot2`. These are summarised below.

### Anatomy

Creating a basic plot with `ggplot2`. In essence the introduction to `ggplot2` usage.

- [__Basic plot__](/ggplot2/basic_plot.qmd): Creation of a basic plot with `ggplot2`
- [__Ggplot object__](/ggplot2/ggplot_object.qmd): Details about the creation of a ggplot2 object.
    - Input data: The required input format data for `ggplot2`. 
    - Aesthetics: What they are, the different types, and their usage.
- [__Layers__](/ggplot2/layers.qmd): What layers are and how to add them to a `ggplot2` object.

### Output

How to save the output of `ggplot2` objects.

- `ggsave()`: Save a `ggplot` object/figure to a static image file.
- `pathcwork`: Combing multiple `gpglot2` objects into the same graphic/image. (https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)
- `ggplotly()`: Convert a `ggplot2` object to an interactive plotly object and save it as an HTML file.

### Geoms

There are many different geoms (i.e. types of plots). 
This website will cover a few of the most commonly used ones.

- `geom_bar()`: Bar chart.
- `geom_histogram()`: histogram.
- `geom_line()`: Line graph.
- `geom_point()`: Scatter plot.
- `geom_boxplot()`: Box and whisker plot.

### Customisation

- Labels: Modifying labels on the axes, legend, and other plot labels.
- Scale values: How to modify the scale of the x and y axis (e.g. plot values as log10 values or square root values)
- Colour scales: How to set the colours for aesthetics.
- Facetting: Creation of multiple of the same type of plot by subsetting the visualised data by one or two metadata categories.
- Abline: Adding a straight line to a plot and its corresponding y=mx+c equation.
- Coordinate systems: Modify how the x and y aesthetics combine.
