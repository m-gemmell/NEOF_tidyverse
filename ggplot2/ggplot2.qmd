## Overview

__Ggplot2__ is the visualisation package of __Tidyverse__.
It utilises the __grammar of graphics__ (the gg in ggplot2) to create plots/figures in a layered/compartmentalised fashion.

There are multiple parts of a __ggplot2__ figure including:

- The __ggplot2__ object that contains the aesthetics
- The __aesthetics__: This is the data and what they are mapped to (x axis, y-axis, colour etc.)
- The __geom layers__: This is how the aesthetics are visualised (bar chart, boxplot, histogram etc.)
- The __guides__: The text and other information on the axes abd legends (labels, titles, etc.)
- __Facetting__: Splitting of data to multiple plots (e.g. side by side box plots displaying different metrics)


[ggplot2 homepage](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org//)

This website aims to quickly cover the most commonly used `ggplot2` functions and uses.
Therefore there are a lot more `ggplot2` functions than those covered here.
Please check the below link for the full list.

## Sections

There are various sections for `ggplot2`. These are summarised below.

Creating a basic plot with `ggplot2`. In essence the introduction to `ggplot2` usage.

- [__Basic plot__](/ggplot2/basic_plot.qmd): Creation of a basic plot with `ggplot2`
- [__Input data__](/ggplot2/input_data.qmd): The required input format data for `ggplot2`. 
    - Discusses the difference between __tidy/long__ data and __wide/messy__ data.
- [__Aesthetics__](/ggplot2/aesthetics.qmd): What they are, the different types, and their usage.
- [__Components__](/ggplot2/components.qmd): What components are and how to add (`+`) them to a `ggplot2` object.

### Layers

Arguably the most important __component__ for `ggplot2` are the __layers__.
__Layers__ (also known as geom) are used to plot the data in different ways, i.e. different plots.
This website will cover a few of the most commonly used ones.

- `geom_bar()`: Bar chart.
- `geom_histogram()`: histogram.
- `geom_line()`: Line graph.
- `geom_point()`: Scatter plot.
- `geom_boxplot()`: Box and whisker plot.

### Output

How to save the output of `ggplot2` objects.

- `ggsave()`: Save a `ggplot` object/figure to a static image file.
- `pathcwork`: Combing multiple `gpglot2` objects into the same graphic/image. (https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)
- `ggplotly()`: Convert a `ggplot2` object to an interactive plotly object and save it as an HTML file.

### Customisation

On top of __layers__ there are various other __components__.
These include:

- __Labels__: Modifying labels on the axes, legend, and other plot labels.
- __Scale values__: How to modify the scale of the x and y axis (e.g. plot values as log10 values or square root values)
- __Colour scales__: How to set the colours for aesthetics.
- __Facetting__: Creation of multiple of the same type of plot by subsetting the visualised data by one or two metadata categories.
- __Abline__: Adding a straight line to a plot and its corresponding y=mx+c equation.
- __Coordinate systems__: Modify how the x and y aesthetics combine.
