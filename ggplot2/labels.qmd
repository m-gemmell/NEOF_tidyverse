# Labels

The __column/variable__ names in a `tibble` are used to specify the various [aesthetics](/ggplot2/aesthetics.qmd).
By default these names are used as the labels of the various aesthetics (e.g. x and y labels).

However, what makes a good __column/variable__ name does not always make a good label.
The __column/variable__ names we use in these materials have underscores (`_`) and are all uncapitalised (e.g. `mushroom_tbl`).
For our labels we want spaces instead of underscores and we want some capitalisation.

To specify our __aesthetic__ labels we will use the __component__ `labs()`.

## Dataset

We'll recreate many of the plots in the [`geom_point()` chapter](/ggplot2/geom_point.qmd), so we'll load the `mushroom_tbl` data from the [mgrtibbles package](/datasets/mgrtibbles.qmd) (hyperlink includes install instructions).
We will extract a random sample of 150 rows with `slice_sample()`.

[mushroom_tbl details](https://github.com/m-gemmell/mgrtibbles/wiki/mushroom_tbl)

```{r}
#Load package
library("mgrtibbles")
#Set seed for random sampling
set.seed("483")
#mushroom_tbl tibble for demonstration
mushroom_tbl <- mgrtibbles::mushroom_tbl |>
    #Random sample of 150 rows
    dplyr::slice_sample(n = 150, replace=FALSE)
#Reset random seed to normal operation
set.seed(NULL)
#Glimpse tibble
mushroom_tbl |> dplyr::glimpse()
```

## Axes labels

The most common labels to add to a ggplot are the x and y labels.

Create the [default scatter plot](/ggplot2/geom_point.qmd#default-scatter-plot).
We'll specify the x and y labels in the `ggplot2::lab()` function with `x=`, and `y=`.

```{r}
mushroom_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = stem_width, y = stem_height)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Stem width", y = "Stem height")
```

## Legend labels

When some __aesthetics__ are added a corresponding __legend__ is added to the plot.
We can change the labels of these legends with `labs()`.

Create the [scatter plot with colour & shape groups](/ggplot2/geom_point.qmd#colour--shape-groups).
Assign label names for the x, y, shape, and colour __aesthetics__.

```{r}
mushroom_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = stem_width, y = stem_height, 
                        shape = class, colour = cap_shape)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point(size = 2) +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Stem width", y = "Stem height", 
                        shape = "Class", colour = "Cap shape")
```

## Title

Two other useful labels to add to a plot is the title and sub title labels.

Create the [Scatter plot with points sized by a continuous variable](/ggplot2/geom_point.qmd#size-by-continuous-variable).
This time we'll include a title (`title=`) and sub title (`subtitle=`), as well as setting the size legend with `size=` in the `labs()` function.

```{r}
mushroom_tbl |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = stem_width, y = stem_height, size = cap_diameter)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Stem width", y = "Stem height", size = "Cap diameter",
                        title = "Mushroom stem height (y) against stem width (x)",
                        subtitle = "The size of the points are based in the cap diameters")
```
