### and_vertebrates

Records for aquatic vertebrates (cutthroat trout and salamanders) in Mack Creek, Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon (1987 - present)

`r hide("List of variables")`
- __year__: a number indicating the observation year
- __sitecode__: a character denoting the coded name of sample area
- __section__: a character denoting the section in Mack Creek (CC = clear cut forest, OG = upstream old growth coniferous forest)
- __reach__: a character denoting the reach sampled from each section; L = lower reach (0 - 50 meters), M = middle reach (50 - 100 meters), U = upper reach (100  150 meters)
- __pass__: a number denoting the electroshocking pass number, either 1 or 2
- __unitnum__: a number denoting the channel unit number
- __unittype__: a character denoting the channel unit classification type (C = cascade, I = riffle, IP = isolated pool (not connected to channel), P = pool, R = rapid, S = step (small falls), SC = side channel, NA = not sampled by unit)
- __vert_index__: a number denoting the unique index for each vertebrate
- __pitnumber__: a number denoting the unique tag number embedded into vertebrate (tagging started in 2007)
- __species__: a character denoting species measured
- __length_1_mm__: a number denoting vertebrate length in millimeters; total or snout-fork length for trout, and snout-vent length for salamanders
- __length_2_mm__: a number denoting snout-tail length in millimeters (for Coastal giant salamander only)
- __weight_g__: a number denoting vertebrate mass in grams
- __clip__: a character denoting the fin clip type for cutthroat trout, ended in 2006 (LV = left ventral fin; LVRV = left and right ventral fins; RV = right ventral fin; NONE = no ventral fin clip)
- __sampledate__: a date denoting the date of observation
- __notes__: a character denoting additional comments
