The function `pivot_longer()` longifys data, converting it from wide to long.
Long data is generally the preferred format for __Tidyverse__, and is especially useful for [`ggplot2`](/ggplot2/ggplot2.qmd).

When data is longified:

- The number of rows increases.
- The number of columns decreases.

To longify data a set of columns are chosen.

- The column names are assigned as data of a __names__ column.
- The values within the columns are assigned to a __value__ column. Each value is within its own row.

## Dataset

For demonstration we'll load the `fisheries_wide_tbl` data from the [mgrtibbles package](/datasets/mgrtibbles.qmd) (hyperlink includes install instructions).

[fisheries_wide_tbl details](https://github.com/m-gemmell/mgrtibbles/wiki/fisheries_wide_tbl)

```{r}
#Load package
library("mgrtibbles")
#fisheries_wide_tbl tibble for demonstration
mgrtibbles::fisheries_wide_tbl |>
    #View first 11 columns with select
    dplyr::select(1:11)
```

## Wide to long

Pivot the __wide tibble__ to a __long tibble__.

The three options provided below are:

- The columns to use for longifying.
    - Below `!Entity` is used to longify all but the `Entity` column.
    - String vectors can be used.
- `names_to=`: New column in long data containing the __names__ of the longified columns.
- `values_to=`: New column in long data containing the __values__ of the longified columns.

```{r}
fisheries_wide_tbl |> 
    tidyr::pivot_longer(!Entity, names_to="Year", values_to = "Metric_tons")
```

## More metadata columns

What if we have more than one metadata column such as in the `world_pop_wide_tbl` displayed below?

```{r}
world_pop_wide_tbl
```

In this case in it easier to specify which columns we want longified.
That is columns 2022 to 1970.

```{r}
world_pop_wide_tbl |> 
    tidyr::pivot_longer(`2022`:`1970`, names_to="Year", values_to="Population")
```

__Note:__ Quotes are used for `2022` and `1970` as column/variable names that are numbers need them or they will not work.
