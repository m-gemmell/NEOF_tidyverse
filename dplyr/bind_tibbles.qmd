title: "Bind tibbles"

__Tibbles__ can be bound together to create a new __tibble__ with `dplyr::bind_cols()` and `dplyr::bind_rows()`.

[Tidyverse reference page](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org//reference/add_rows_and_columns.html)

## Create example tibbles

Before demonstrating various examples we will create a few __tibbles__.

```{r}
num_tbl <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9)
num_tbl_2 <- tibble::tibble(aa = 11:13, ab = 14:16, ac = 17:19)
num_tbl_3 <- tibble::tibble(x = 4:6, y = 7:9, z = 10:12)
```

## Bind by columns

Bind 2 or more __tibbles__ by columns.
In other words you will end up with more columns and the same amount of rows.

We will bind the two following __tibbles__ by columns.

__Note__ that the two __tibbles__ must have the same amount of rows.
Additionally, they should have completely unique column names compared to each other.

```{r}
num_tbl
```

```{r}
num_tbl_2
```

Column bind

```{r}
num_tbl_col_bound <- dplyr::bind_cols(num_tbl, num_tbl_2)
num_tbl_col_bound
```

## Bind by rows

Bind 2 or more __tibbles__ by rows with `dplyr::bind_rows()`.
In other words you will end up with more rows and the same amount of columns.

We will bind the two following __tibbles__ by rows.

__Note__ that the two __tibbles__ must have the same amount of columns.
Additionally, they should have the same column names.

```{r}
num_tbl
```

```{r}
num_tbl_3
```

Row bind

```{r}
num_tbl_row_bound <- dplyr::bind_rows(num_tbl, num_tbl_3)
num_tbl_row_bound
```
