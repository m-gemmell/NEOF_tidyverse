The function `group_by()` converts a __tibble__ into a grouped __tbl__.
The grouping is based on one or more specified columns/variables.

This allows you to carry out various functions in a groupwise manner.
These functions are covered in other pages in this section.

## Dataset

For demonstration we'll load the `amphibian_div_tbl` data from the [mgrtibbles package](/datasets/mgrtibbles.qmd) (hyperlink includes install instructions).

```{r}
#Load package
library("mgrtibbles")
#amphibian_div_tbl tibble for demonstration
mgrtibbles::amphibian_div_tbl
```

## One variable/column

Group by one variable/column.

The grouped __tibble's__ second top line of info states the grouping and the number of different items in the group (`[]`).

```{r}
amphibian_div_tbl |> dplyr::group_by(IUCN.Red.List.Status)
```

## Multiple variables/columns into one group

Group using multiple columns.

```{r}
amphibian_dv_lineage_group_tbl <- amphibian_div_tbl |> dplyr::group_by(Order, Family, Genus)
amphibian_dv_lineage_group_tbl
```

## Ungroup

If required you can remove the grouping from a __tibble__ with `dplyr::ungroup()`.

```{r}
amphibian_dv_lineage_group_tbl |> dplyr::ungroup()
```
