Their are various ways to create __tibbles__. 
Below are three methods:

- Creating a new __tibble__ via code
- Coercing a __data.frame__ into a __tibble__
- Reading in a file as a __tibble__

## Code to tibble

## data.frame to tibble

## File to tibble

We can use __readr's__ function `read_csv()` to read in a file as a __tibble__.
More information: [readr](./readr) 

Ensure you have the following file downloaded: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
house_plants_dbl <- readr::read_csv(file = "all_plant_details.csv")
house_plants_dbl
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
house_plants_dbl <- readr::read_csv(file = "../files/all_plant_details.csv")
house_plants_dbl
```
