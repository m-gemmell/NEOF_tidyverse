Tibbles are formatted like a __data.frame__ but have some extra functions and terminology.

Below is an example of a simple tibble.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Vectors to be used as columns
Month <- rep("January", 3)
Sex <- 
Species <- 
Hawks <- c(3,7,2)
Pigeons <- c(52,21,61)
Starlings <- c(1,2,1)
#Create a tibble
tbl <- tibble::tibble(Day, Month, Hawks, Pigeons, Starlings)
#View tibble
#Note that the column names are the same as the vector names
tbl
```
