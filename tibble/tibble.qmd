## Overview

A __tibble__ (`tbl`) is a reimagining of the __data.frame__ (`df`) object. They are described as __data.frames__ that are:

- __Lazy__: They don't change variable names and they partial matching does not work.
- __Surly__: They complain more such as when a variable does not exist.

One important note is that __tibbles__ don't have row names.

Although __tibbles__ have advantages compared to __data.frames__ they are not always more suited to the task than __data.frames__. 
However, __tibbles__ are generally always preferred over __data.frames__ when using __tidyverse__ packages.

## Tibble example

Below is an example of:

- Creating a basic tibble
- Printing the tibble

```{r}
#Create a tibble
tbl <- tibble::tibble(Day = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed"),
              Hawks = c(3,7,2),
              Pigeons = c(52,21,61),
              Starlings = c(1,2,1))
#Print tibble
tbl
```
