have:\n\n- 10 rows/observations\n- 7 columns/variables\n\n## Rows/observations\n\nAs in a __data.frame__ each observation is within its own row.\nThe contents of an observation/row is determined by

\n\n__Tibble__ rows do not have row names and you cannot/should not give them row names.\nThey are numbered/indexxed instead.\n\n## Variables/columns\n\nA __tibble__ will have a certain number of columns.\n\nEach column has a name that is at the top. \nFor example:\n\n- year\n- watershed\n- elevation\n\nBelow the column/variable names is the data class/type of the column.\nAll the entries within a single column will have the same data class.\nThese include:\n\n- __\\<int>__: [Integer](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/04-R_objects.html#numeric)\n- __\\<dbl>__: [Double](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/04-R_objects.html#numeric)\n- __\\<chr>__: [Character/String](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/04-R_objects.html#string)\n- __\\<fct>__:

(Lubridate link to be added)\n- __\\<list>__: List\n\nBelow is an example of a __tibble__ with a column for each of these classes.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\n#Vectors to be used as columns\nIntegers <- as.integer(c(101,21,3.3,0.04))\nDoubles <- as.double(c(0.345,3.14,78.9,20000.9))\nCharacters <- c(\"One\",\"sentence\",\"is\",\"enough\")\nFactors <- as.factor(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"A\"))\nLogicals <-

tibble::tibble(Integers, Doubles, Characters,Factors,Logicals,Dates, Lists)\n#View tibble\n#Note that the column names are the same as the vector names\ntbl\n```\n\nAbove you can see that when you view a __tibble__, by printing it or viewing it in an Rstudio tab, it will align the values in the columns in a easy to read manner.\nThis is especially useful for numeric (integers & doubles) columns where the numbers are aligned by place value.\nThis allows you to easily compare the size of numbers in the same column.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n<center>\n![](images/tibble_structure.png){style=\"width:200px\"}\n</center>\n\nTibbles are formatted like a __data.frame__ but have some extra functions and
