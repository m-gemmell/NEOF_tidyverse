They are described as __data.frames__ that are:\n\n- __Lazy__: They don't change variable names and they partial matching does not work.\n- __Surly__: They complain more such as when a variable does not exist.\n\nOne important note is that __tibbles__ don't have row names.\n\nAlthough __tibbles__ have advantages compared to __data.frames__ they are not always more suited to the task than __data.frames__. \nHowever, __tibbles__ are generally always preferred over __data.frames__ when using __tidyverse__ packages.\n\n[Tibble homepage](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)\n\n## Sections\n\nThe sections in this book are:\n\n- [Creating tibbles](/tibble/creating_tibbles.qmd): Creating __tibbles__ with code, data.frame coercion, and reading in from files.\n- [Structure](/tibble/structure.qmd): Demonstrates the sturcture/format of a __tibble__.\n- [Subsetting](/tibble/subsetting.qmd): Subsetting __tibbles__ and the difference between using `$` and `[]`.\n- [Printing or viewing](/tibble/printing.qmd): Unique features of viewing __tibbles__.\n- [Adding rows and columns](/tibble/add_rows_and_columns.qmd): How to add new rows/columns and bind tibbles together.\n\n## Tibble example\n\nBelow is an example of:\n\n- Creating a basic tibble\n- Printing the tibble\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create a tibble\ntbl <- tibble::tibble(Day = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\"),\n              Hawks = c(3,7,2),\n              Pigeons = c(52,21,61),\n              Starlings = c(1,2,1))\n#Print tibble\ntbl\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  Day   Hawks Pigeons Starlings\n  <chr> <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 Mon       3      52         1\n2 Tue       7      21         2\n3 Wed       2      61         1\n```\n:::\n:::",
