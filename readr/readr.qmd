## Overview

`Readr` is primarily used to read in __rectangular data__ from a __delimited file__ into R as a [tibble](/tibble/tibble.qmd) or write data to a file.

__Rectangular data__ generally refers to tables.

__Delimited data__ means that the columns/fields are delimited/separated by a character. Common delimiting characters include spaces (` `), commas (`,`), and tabs (`\t`).
