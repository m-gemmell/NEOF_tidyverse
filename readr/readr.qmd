## Overview

`Readr` is primarily used to read in __rectangular data__ from a __delimited file__ into R as a [tibble](/tibble/tibble.qmd) or write data to a file.

__Rectangular data__ generally refers to tables.

__Delimited data__ means that the columns/fields are delimited/separated by a character. Common delimiting characters include spaces (` `), commas (`,`), and tabs (`\t`).

## Data

Rather than downloading files to then read in to R, we will use the URL of files uploaded to this website.

If you are interested in information and/or downloading the data you can view the following page: [Data files](/datasets/data_files.qmd)

## Sections

The sections of `readr` are summarised below.

### Read

The `readr::read_delim()` function reads in __delimited rectangular data__ from a file to a __tibble__.

Topics covered are:

- [Read_delim()](/readr/read.qmd): Reading in data with `readr::read_delim()` and specifying the delimiter with `delim=`. Common delimiters are comma (`,`), tab (`\t`), and space (` `).
- [Column types](/readr/column_types.qmd): Specifying the data types (double, integer, character, factor, logical etc.) of the columns when reading in data with `readr::read_delim()`. Particularly important when you want integer or factor columns.
- [Misc read options](/readr/read_misc.qmd): Three miscellaneous options for `readr::read_delim()`.
    - `id=`: Adds an ID column containing the file path.
    - `skip=`: Skips a specified number of lines from the top of the file.
    - `n_max=`: Specify the max number of lines/rows to read into a __tibble__.

### Write

The [`readr::write_delim()`](/readr/write.qmd) writes __tibbles__ and other table data to files.
