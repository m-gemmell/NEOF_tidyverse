Although there are specific functions for some delimiters this page will show you how to write out data with any delimiter using `readr::write_delim()` and the `delim=` option.

The most common types of delimiters for rectangular data files are:

- Commas (`,`): Files with commas as delimiters are known as CSV files (Comma Separated Values) and commonly end with the suffix __.csv__
- Tabs (`\t`): Files with tabs as delimiters are known as TSV files (Tab Separated Values) and commonly end with the suffix __.tsv__
- Spaces (` `): Spaces are used as delimiters for many files but are generally not recommended in data science

Additionally, non-standard delimiters can be specified. Tilde (`~`), Colon (`:`), Semi-colon (`;`), Pipe (`|`) are commonly used as non-standard delimiters. 

## Data

We'll write the first five lines of [all_plant_details.csv](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/data/all_plant_details.csv) to various files with different delimiters.

For convenience read in the data, slice it and assign it to a variable called __plant_detail_slice_tbl__.

```{r}
plant_detail_slice_tbl <- readr::read_delim(
    file = "https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/data/all_plant_details.csv",
    delim = ",", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
    dplyr::slice(1:5) 
```

## Comma delimited

To write a data to a file with comma (`,`) delimiters you can use the option `delim = ","`.

### Write comma delimited file

Write the variable __plant_detail_slice_tbl__ to a comma delimited file called __all_plant_slice.csv__.

```{r}
readr::write_delim(plant_detail_slice_tbl, "plant_detail_slice.csv", delim = ",")
```

### Comma delimited file contents

Print the file contents of __all_plant_slice.txt__.

```{r}
readLines("plant_detail_slice.csv")
```

## Tab delimited

To write a data to a file with comma (`\t`) delimiters you can use the option `delim = "\t"`.

### Write tab delimited file

Write the variable __plant_detail_slice_tbl__ to a tab delimited file called __all_plant_slice.tsv__.

```{r}
readr::write_delim(plant_detail_slice_tbl, "plant_detail_slice.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

### Tab delimited file contents

Print the file contents of __all_plant_slice.tsv__.

If you were to open the file in a text editor it would most likely represent the `\t` characters as tab space.

```{r}
readLines("plant_detail_slice.tsv")
```

## Space delimited

By default `readr::write_delim()` will use a space as the delimiter character.
Therefore you do not need to provide the `delim=` option.

### Write space delimited file

Write the variable __plant_detail_slice_tbl__ to a space delimited file called __all_plant_slice.txt__.

```{r}
readr::write_delim(plant_detail_slice_tbl, "plant_detail_slice.txt")
```

### Space delimited file contents

Print the file contents of __all_plant_slice.txt__.

You will notice the 6th line has __\"Jacob's coat\"__. As this value had a space the `\"` are used to indicate that __Jacob's coat__ is the value within one field. 

```{r}
readLines("plant_detail_slice.txt")
```

## Non-standard delimiters

You can use many other characters as delimiters when writing files.
This can be useful if your data contains the three common delimiters (comm, tab, and space).

The most common non-standard delimiters are:

- __Tilde__ (`~`)
- __Colon__ (`:`)
- __Semi-colon__ (`;`)
- __Pipe__ (`|`)

### Write non-standard delimited file

Write the variable __plant_detail_slice_tbl__ to a pipe (`|`) delimited file called __all_plant_slice.pipe_delimit.text__.

```{r}
readr::write_delim(plant_detail_slice_tbl, "plant_detail_slice.pipe_delimit.text", delim = "|")
```

### Non-standard delimited file contents

Print the file contents of __all_plant_slice.pipe_delimit.text__.

```{r}
readLines("plant_detail_slice.pipe_delimit.text")
```
