The `readr::read_delim()` function allows you to read in __delimited rectangular data__ from a file to a __tibble__.

We will only cover `readr::read_delim()` but the full list of read functions are below:

- `readr::read_delim()`: The base read functions.
- `readr::read_csv()`: As `readr::read_delim()` but uses commas (`,`) as the default delimiter.
- `readr::read_csv2()`: For some European fromatted data. As `readr::read_delim()` but uses semi colons (`;`) as the default delimiter and uses commas (`,`) for decimal points.
- `readr::read_tsv()`: As `readr::read_delim()` but uses tabs (`\t`) as the default delimiter.
