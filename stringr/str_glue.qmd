The function `stringr::str_glue()` is similar to [`str_c()`](/stringr/str_c.qmd) but allows you to include variable names within double quotes.

Variables to be used are flanked by curly braces, e.g. `"{variable_name}"`.

## Scalars

You can include a string variable into a string specified in `stringr::glue()`.

```{r}
#Create a string scalar
base <- "A"
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("Adenine is represented by the letter {base}")
```

You can include multiple variables.

```{r}
#Create string vectors
base <- "A"
comp <- "T"
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("The complementary base of {base} is {comp}")
```

Like `paste0()` or `str_c()` you can combine multiple strings and set a separator.
In this case the option is `.sep=`.

```{r}
#Create string vectors
dna <- "T"
rna <- "U"
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("{dna} is a nucleic acid DNA base.",
                    "{rna} is a nucleic acid RNA base.",
                    .sep = " ")
```


If you need to display something such as `{base}` you can use double braces (`{{{base}}}`).

Additionally we will use a new space (`\n`) as the separator.

```{r}
stringr::str_glue("You can include a variable with str_glue with braces, e.g. {{base}}.",
                    "For example, here is adenine: {base}.",
                    .sep = "\n") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

## Non strings

Non strings are converted into strings.

```{r}
#Create a numeric scalar
num <- 4
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("There are {num} DNA bases")
```

With numerics you can carry out maths in the braces.

```{r}
stringr::str_glue("There are {num/2} purines.",
                    "There are {num-1} pyrimidines",
                    .sep = "\n") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

Below shows how logicals and missing values work.

```{r}
#Vectors
true <- TRUE
missing <- NA
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("Logical: {true}. Missing value: {missing}.") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

## Vectors

Using vectors with `str_glue()` works the same way as `str_c()`.

```{r}
#Create vec
bases <- c("A","G","C","T")
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("A DNA base is {bases}") |> stringr::str_view()
```

When using multiple vectors ensure they are the same length.

```{r}
#Create vec
bases <- c("A","G","C","T")
names <- c("Adenine", "Guanine", "Cytosine", "Thymine")
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("{names} is represented by {bases}") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

Using vectors of different lengths will lead to an error but you can always use scalars with vectors.

```{r}
#Create vec
type <- "DNA"
#Glue
stringr::str_glue("The {type} base {names} is represented by {bases}") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```
