The function `stringr::str_c()` combines multiple character vectors into a single character vector.
It is similar to the `paste0()` function.

[Tidyverse reference page](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_c.html)

## Scalar and vector

We can combine one string to a vector of strings.

Add "day" to the end of the weekday prefixes.

```{r}
#Create a vector
vec <- c("Mon", "Tues", "Wednes", "Thurs", "Fri")
#Combine with day at the end
weekdays <- stringr::str_c(vec, "day")
#View
weekdays |> stringr::str_view()
```

A separator can be chosen between the strings to be combined with `sep=`.

Using the created `weekdays` vector print out the weekdays with "Weekday" at the start and the sperator `: ` (note the space after the `:`).

```{r}
#Combine with day at the end
stringr::str_c("Weekday", weekdays, sep = ": ") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

Of course you can combine more than two string objects.

Create a longer sentence with the `weekday` in the middle.

```{r}
#Combine with day at the end
stringr::str_c("The day ", weekdays, " is a weekday.") |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

## Vector and vector

You can combine multiple vectors together.

Create sentences stating the national plants of the four UK countries.

```{r}
#Create vectors
plants <- c("Rose", "Thistle", "Leek", "Shamrock")
countries <- c("England", "Scotland", "Wales", "Northern Ireland")
#Combine vectors
stringr::str_c("The ", plants, " is the national plant of ", countries) |>
    stringr::str_view()
```

## Recycling elements

With `paste0()` vectors of different length can be combined using the [recycling rule](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/17-Basic_programming.html#recycle-rule).

```{r}
#Create vectors
vec1 <- c("a", "b", "c")
vec2 <- c("y", "z")
#Combine vectors
paste0(vec1, vec2)
```

On the other hand `str_c()` does not work with vectors of different lengths.
If you run the below command it will not work.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Combine vectors
stringr::str_c(vec1, vec2)
```

## Missing values

Missing values in R are presented as `NA`.

When a `NA` is used in `paste0()` it will treat it as a string.
You can see this in action in the below command when the `"b"` is combined with `"NA"`.

```{r}
#Create vectors
vec1 <- c("a", "b", "c")
vec2 <- c("x", NA, "z")
#Combine vectors
paste0(vec1, vec2)
```

A `NA` with `str_c()` produces a `NA`.
Notice how the second value is a proper missing value (`NA`) with no quotes

```{r}
#Combine vectors
stringr::str_c(vec1, vec2) 
```
